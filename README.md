Fruit Classification with Machine Learning:
  This project uses machine learning and computer vision to classify different types of fruits from images. The model is trained on a labeled fruit dataset and can accurately recognize multiple fruit categories based on their color, shape, and texture.
ðŸ”¹ Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
ðŸ”¹ Supports multiple fruit classes
ðŸ”¹ Achieved high accuracy on the test set
